The Orange Tree


When I was thirteen,
I completed a rite of passage
and was given an orange tree.

When I was 23,
I went to the dump with my father,
with the tree in the truck.

The tree left with us,
Even after my father said 
it had been through too much,
and would never bear fruit.

When I was 25,
I came home for the holidays
And my mother showed me
The only orange on my tree.

It had scared skin,
and lumpy shape
and I was afraid to eat it.

I kept it in the fridge for over a month,
Till my love asked me
To eat it or throw it out.

Left with little choice,
I sliced it in half,
peeled back the skin,
And took a bite

Of the most delicious orange, 
I had ever tasted.




But I felt I had to try.

But it left with us,
Because I could not give up on it

I before we left,
