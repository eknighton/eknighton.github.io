Fighting Game


Melee focuses on using enemies against eachother- deflecting attacks, baiting & dodging, and repositing enemies with kicks, grabs, throws.

Additionally, exposure to magic can enable element specific ultimates.


Fire Ultimate:
Fire allows you to enter a rage where you build up heat. Heat decreases over time, and damages you while also improving your damage, power, and speed.
Additionally, it replaces kicks with 'meteor' self-launch attacks. It also adds a flame cannon attack.

Lightning Ultimate:
While active, your actions become super-fast, and have shorter cooldowns. Your attacks become quicker, and combo chains longer / more complex.
Block is replaced with a lightning bolt attack that stuns enemies, potentially causing them to misfire.

Stealth Ultimate:
Block is replaced with invisibility, and grab is replaces with throwing smoke grenades.

Water Ultimate:
Actions can now interupt themselves, ex. attack can interrupt attack, resulting in unique effects.
