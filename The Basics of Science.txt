The Basics of Science


Models with the power to anticipate the unknown 


1. The power of imperfect theories.

"Unlike theories,
No model is ever disproven,
We only learn better what it does."

2. Discrimination

"How can you tell the difference between a world where it is, and one where it is not?"

3. Possibility of Agreement

-> The path to agreement on such matters involves power. They can never be resolved among equals.

4. The unwinnable game

Science is about deciding how to face the unknown. Thank evolution that we've faired as well as we have.
