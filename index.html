<div class = "intro"><p>
The apparent randomness of quantum events may not be random at all. Rather ALL possible outcomes might occur, each in a different UNIVERSE generated by the event.
If this acclaimed interpretation of quantum physics were true, what would happen if you based your decisions on such outcomes? Well, for one thing you’d be able to turn inconsequential differences between worlds into meaningful ones- to go from “In these world the atom did this" to “In these worlds he had pizza and in these worlds he had cake!” Check out all our multiverse shaping tools below!

<p>	Q: Don't these divides naturally occur?</p>
<p> A: Yes, they are theoretically guaranteed. This feature lets you make them way more common, but adds no/negligable diversity.<p>
