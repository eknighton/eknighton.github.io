TODO
3. Expand player HUD
4. Support gifs/videos/sounds
5. Improve support for non-panel displays (ex.canvas)
6. Remove the less reliable self-refence systems for panels

Sounds

GIFS
1. Gif / video support would be sweet!

TIMER
1. May not always correct initial number.

SCOPE
1. Panels in the panel array can access themselves by ID, and several other extraneously added methods- these should be removed.
2. Onloads & Actions in dynamic panels not the array can access their panel, but other items in the panel cannot (However, on load can make it accessible by setting me to it) 

Features
1. Each button can execute custom code on click
2. Each panel automatically saves, and can be dynamically edited, reset.


Item Support
1. No good system for mining data about what an action does?
2. Potentially limited support for renaming content
