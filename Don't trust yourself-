Don't trust yourself-



Make me someone I don't want to be,

Changed so much that she did.


I knew it would make a difference in three days,
So instead it made a difference in two.

I don't make the rules, but I choose to live by them.



But rules

say it is my fault...



You blame me,
convinced you are powerless
To have prevented it.


You must think so little of yourself,

Forgiven

The giant shouldered,
the burdens
that small man had dropped.
