I am fading,
I need nothing,
and so my body
Gives it all back.



Back To Reality


I am bored
By who I was;
I don't recall

What makes an event an injury?


Add injustice to injury,
or cruelty,

Still Me- being yourself




She scraped her knee,
and felt it made her more herself,
though later, when a bike hit her,
she was uspet about the bruise on her arm.

Her father was horrified when she was scarred
By a tattoo artist putting ink 
where it did not belong.
She poked holes in her ears,
and I wondered what she was thinking,
hurting herself like that.

She was disappointed when
the proceedure was deemed cosmetic,
Leaving her unable to afford to heal.

On her 90th birthday
she looked in the mirror,
and wondered
"Is age not injury"




Mostly undone

Cut Out Moments

In preschool she scraped her knee.
She showed the scab off proudly,
thinking that it made her more herself.

After she returned from college,
her father realized
she had been scarred
by a tattoo artist putting ink 
where it did not belong.

Shortly after her son turned seventeen, 
she went to therapy,
because she tried to hurt herself,
while cancer ravaged her body.

Fourteen years later, she had a gradson
and a couple times she helped him up, 
after he fell down.

On her 90th birthday
she looked in the mirror,
and wondered if her god
would heal the ravages of time.

How can one hurt themself?




These Injuries

are little parts of my story
that I'd like to erase
a little more,
so I can take it in a new
and exciting
direciton.



Scar Tissue

There is no healing,
without injury.

Most injuries
were inflicted on things,
not people,
and certainly not you-

If anything,
you are scar tissue
in an ancient wound.

You will not be here,
if it is healed-
but what will you become?
