I was inspired by the 'Grooks' of Piet Hein, and dissatisfied with modern movements in poetry that focus on conveying personal experiences and feelings, rather than broader understandings.  


With most poems I work to present a lesson, demonstrate it's potential value, and provide a case in which they might use it. All within less than 30 words.

My poems are fable-like, often telling fictional stories to demonstrate the impact a particular change in thinking or behavior can have. I try to be friendly to overly-analytical readers, working to make sure readers feel they understand what I am trying to say, and that I am indeed saying something.




There I things I want to help people do- poetry is my tool. I want to give people ideas that will help them adapt to their environment, and to address those mysteries we encounter no matter where we go.

I want people to read and be moved, and to bear the mark of my writing for years to come. I want my reader to often stand out in a crowd because they were changed by my words. I do not seek merely to make my reader feel, for we can be moved to so much more than tears.
