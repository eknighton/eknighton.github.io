Puzzle Completeness



1. Topology completeness.

- All game state graphs can be contructed

2. Visibility completeness

- Any information state is acheiveable. 

3. Analogy Completeness

- 1 to 1 correspondence between actions in a representation of the level as another type of puzzle, and actions in the puzzle.

1.
	A 1 way state-to state gate (A way to make an Action or Motion irreversible)
	Virtual "tunnels" that can overlap inf # of times.
	Or ways to modify 


1.
	A. A non-finite set of gamestates "S" that can be arbitrarily connected, each to any subset of S, with one-directional "paths".

	Acheiving this is easier if you have irreversible actions, or one-way walkways.
	It also helps if you can connect points in space without also necessarily connecting other points.

2. 
	A. Every possible subset of topologies must monogamously pair with a state that can occur as a node anywhere in all of those topoligies.

	This requires lots of control over what is visible in a given state. Dynamic visibility, and ways to make something visible or not from a given place, are a key to this.

	B. (Impossibly) Every possible subset of arrangements of a subset of those states such that it covers a topology must be monogamously paired with one of those states.

	If acheived, the player would be able to have any possible partial information about what they'd be able to directly observe from another state. 

	C. (In Lieu of B) Designer should have a flexible option to give the player information in a gamestate about what information they'll have access to in another game state.

	This enables information seeking gameplay.

3. 
	A. There should be a simple way to translate a puzzle into your game, such that each solution step to that puzzle can be translated into your game.
